Danger Log
1. when we are doing shopping cart function, the product in each cart may contain different ups_id and addresses
    SOlVED: 
2. Shipid cannot be successfully added to google protocal buffer. 
    SOLVED: We found that it is because the corresponding 
   packages are not filtered correctly. It is because the status 
   which is sent from world is all in captital letters 
   but we were using all lowercase letters.

3. A response from world cannot be received. 
    SOLVED: We solved it by deleting a receive message at the wrong place. 
   It was received by another receive function.
